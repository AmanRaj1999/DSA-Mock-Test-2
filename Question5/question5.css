/* Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code example each */

/* Static: The default position value for elements. Elements with a static position are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. */

.static-example {
  position: static;
}

/* Fixed: An element with a fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window and will not move even if the page is scrolled. */

.fixed-example {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
}

/* Sticky: A sticky positioned element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It acts like a hybrid of fixed and relative positioning, as it starts as a normal flow element and then becomes fixed once the user scrolls to a certain threshold. */
.sticky-example {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}

/* Relative: An element with a relative position is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. It can be moved with the top, right, bottom, and left properties. */
.relative-example {
  position: relative;
  left: 50px;
}

/* Absolute: An element with an absolute position is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If no ancestor has a positioned property, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block. It can be moved with the top, right, bottom, and left properties. */

.absolute-example {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 50px;
}
